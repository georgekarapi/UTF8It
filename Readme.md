# UTF8It
A simple script created in **Python 3.5** for those who are struggling by the "weird" subtitle characters showing on video players. This utility just recognises file encoding using **cchardet** library and then creates a new file-copy with UTF-8 encoding.

## Usage
<b>Terminal</b><br/>
utf8it {[-options] [file/folder(1)] [file/folder(2)]...}<br/>

Options:<br/>

       e : Show file encoding without converting it
<b>Binary</b><br/>
Drag'n drop the file(s) or folder(s) you want to convert.
