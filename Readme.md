# UTF8It
A simple script created in **Python 3.5** for those who are struggling by the "weird" subtitle characters showing on video players. This utility just recognises file encoding using **cchardet** library and then creates a new file-copy with UTF-8 encoding.

## Usage

utf8it {[-options] [file/folder(1)] [file/folder(2)]...}<br/>

<b>Options:</b><br/>

       e : Show file encoding without converting it
